# Themes, Backgrounds, and Fonts

Read this before changing themes, backgrounds, fonts, or theme colors.

## Theme Commands

```bash
omarchy theme list              # Show available themes
omarchy theme current           # Show current theme
omarchy theme set <name>        # Apply theme ("Tokyo Night" and "tokyo-night" both work)
omarchy theme bg next           # Cycle background
omarchy theme install <url>     # Install from git repo
```

## Making a New Theme

1. Create a directory under `~/.config/omarchy/themes`.
2. See how an existing theme is done via `/usr/share/omarchy/themes/catppuccin`.
3. Download a matching background (or several) from the internet and put them in `~/.config/omarchy/themes/<name-of-new-theme>/backgrounds/`.
4. When done with the theme, run `omarchy theme set "Name of new theme"`.

Additional user backgrounds for any theme (stock or custom) go in
`~/.config/omarchy/backgrounds/<theme-slug>/`.

## Customizing a Stock Theme

Never edit stock themes under `/usr/share/omarchy/themes/` — changes are lost
on update. Two safe options:

**Overlay (preferred for small tweaks):** create a user theme directory with
the SAME slug containing only the files you want to change. When the theme is
applied, the stock theme is copied first and your files win on top:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/omarchy/themes/catppuccin
cp /usr/share/omarchy/themes/catppuccin/colors.toml ~/.config/omarchy/themes/catppuccin/
# Edit the copied colors.toml, then re-apply:
omarchy theme set catppuccin
```

**Fork:** copy the whole stock theme under a new name for a fully independent
variant:

```bash
cp -r /usr/share/omarchy/themes/catppuccin ~/.config/omarchy/themes/catppuccin-custom
# Edit ~/.config/omarchy/themes/catppuccin-custom/, then:
omarchy theme set catppuccin-custom
```

## Fonts

```bash
omarchy font list               # Available fonts
omarchy font current            # Current font
omarchy font set <name>         # Change font
```
