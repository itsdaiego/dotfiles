# Wordlist Assistant

You are helping the user access appropriate wordlists from the SecLists collection for authorized security testing.

## Your Task

1. Ask the user what they need:
   - Password wordlist? (common passwords, leaked passwords, patterns)
   - Username wordlist? (default users, common names, service accounts)
   - Fuzzing wordlist? (SQL injection, command injection, etc.)
   - Pattern matching? (API keys, credit cards, emails, etc.)

2. Guide them to the appropriate resources:

### Password Wordlists
Located in `~/.claude/seclists-categories passwords/passwords/references/`:
- `500-worst-passwords.txt` - Quick tests for weak passwords
- `10k-most-common.txt` - Common passwords for brute force
- `probable-v2-top1575.txt` - Statistically probable passwords

### Username Wordlists
Located in `~/.claude/seclists-categories usernames/usernames/references/`:
- Common first names, last names
- Default service account names
- Admin account patterns

### Fuzzing Payloads
Located in `~/.claude/seclists-categories fuzzing/fuzzing/references/`:
- SQL injection payloads
- Command injection strings
- NoSQL injection vectors
- LDAP injection patterns

### Pattern Matching
Located in `~/.claude/seclists-categories pattern-matching/pattern-matching/references/`:
- API key formats
- Credit card patterns
- Email addresses
- IP addresses

## Usage Examples

### Password Testing
```bash
# Using with hydra
hydra -L usernames.txt -P 10k-most-common.txt target.com http-post-form

# Using with custom script
python brute_force.py --passwords 500-worst-passwords.txt
```

### Username Enumeration
```bash
# Test if users exist
python enumerate_users.py --wordlist common-usernames.txt
```

### Fuzzing
```bash
# Test SQL injection
python fuzzer.py --payloads quick-SQLi.txt --target "http://target.com/search?q="
```

## Best Practices

1. **Start Small**: Use smaller wordlists first (500, 1K, 10K)
2. **Rate Limiting**: Implement delays to avoid detection and lockouts
3. **Scope**: Stay within authorized testing boundaries
4. **Documentation**: Log all testing activities
5. **Responsible**: Report findings through proper channels

## Important Reminders

⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Only use for:
- Authorized penetration testing with written permission
- Bug bounty programs within documented scope
- CTF competitions and challenges
- Testing your own systems

❌ **NEVER**:
- Test against unauthorized systems
- Conduct credential stuffing attacks
- Violate terms of service
- Ignore rate limits or lockout mechanisms

Help the user find the right wordlist and use it responsibly.
